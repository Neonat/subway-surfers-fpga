## 🎮 How to Play

Each player controls a character on a **3-lane grid**. Glowing cubes fall down the lanes — dodge them or you die. The game speeds up over time, just like Subway Surfers. Last player standing wins.

### Rules
- Cubes fall from the top and disappear at the bottom
- If a cube reaches the bottom of **your lane**, you die
- Multiple cubes fall at once, but there is **always at least one safe lane**
- No lives — one hit and you're out
- The session ends when **both players** have died
- Winner is whoever survived longest
